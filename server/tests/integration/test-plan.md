3. WebSocket Communication - Already started
4. API Endpoint Tests - Secondary access method
5. End-to-End Scenarios - Full validation

## Implementation Guidelines
- Minimize mocks, use actual components when possible
- Create test utility functions for common operations
- Test both success and failure cases
- Isolate tests to prevent side effects
- Clean up resources after tests
- Follow "should..." naming pattern for tests
- Group related tests in descriptive test suites
