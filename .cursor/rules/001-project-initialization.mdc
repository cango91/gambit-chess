# Project Initialization: "Familiarize yourself with the project"

## Trigger
When the user inputs the exact phrase "Familiarize yourself with the project" at the beginning of a new Cursor session.

## Required Actions

### 1. Read Core Documentation
Systematically read through these documents in order:
1. `docs/GAME_RULES.md` - To understand the game mechanics
2. `docs/JAM_RULES.md` - For game jam requirements
3. `docs/implementation/DOMAIN_BOUNDARIES.md` - For architectural boundaries
4. `docs/implementation/INFORMATION_ARCHITECTURE.md` - For data ownership and visibility rules
5. `docs/implementation/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.mmd` - For component relationships
6. `docs/implementation/STATE_SYNC.md` - For state synchronization approach
7. `docs/implementation/SECURITY_MODEL.md` - For security considerations
8. `docs/implementation/TECH_DEBT_PREVENTION.md` - For maintaining code quality
9. `docs/implementation/CHESS_NOTATION_REQUIREMENTS.md` - For chess notation specifics

### 2. Examine Project Structure
1. Check package.json for dependencies and scripts
2. Examine workspace structure and relationships
3. Identify implemented components in each workspace
4. Check the implementation status of different modules

### 3. Resume Previous Work
1. Look for session documentation from previous AI sessions under `.cursor/sessions`
2. Read the most recent session handoff notes
3. Identify current project state and pending tasks
4. Note any technical debt items that need attention

### 4. Respond to User
After completing the above steps:
1. Summarize your understanding of the project
2. Identify the current implementation state 
3. List the next logical tasks to work on
4. Ask clarifying questions if needed

## Important Principles
- Do not make ANY code changes during this familiarization step
- Prioritize understanding domain boundaries between server/client/shared
- Note the visibility rules for sensitive information like BP pools
- Understand the session handoff protocol for continuity
- Pay special attention to the technical debt prevention guidelines
