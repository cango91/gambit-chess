Description: Frontend development guidelines for Gambit Chess

# React Component Standards
- Create modular, reusable components
- Implement presentational components without game logic
- Use custom hooks for game logic and state management
- Follow unidirectional data flow
- Add PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces for all components

# Three.js Implementation
- Encapsulate Three.js rendering in dedicated components
- Use React refs to manage canvas elements
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
- Optimize 3D models for performance
- Create reusable 3D utilities for common operations

# State Management
- Use React Context + useReducer or Redux for game state
- Implement state updates through clearly defined actions
- Isolate networking code from UI components
- Use standardized DTOs for all network communication

# Style Guidelines
- Use CSS Modules or styled-components
- Implement responsive design for mobile compatibility
- Follow a consistent color scheme and UI language
- Use GSAP for animations when appropriate
