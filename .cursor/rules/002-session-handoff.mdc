# Session Handoff: "Perform session hand-off"

## Trigger
When the user inputs the exact phrase "Perform session hand-off" at any point during a Cursor session.

## Required Actions

### 1. Document Session Progress
Create or update a session documentation file in `.cursor/sessions/` that includes:

```markdown
## Session Summary

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Focus**: [Component(s) worked on]
**Status**: [Progress made]

### Implemented Components
- [Component Name]: [Status] - [Brief description]
- ...

### Key Decisions
- [Decision]: [Rationale]
- ...

### Known Limitations
- [Limitation]: [Possible future resolution]
- ...

### Next Priority Tasks
- [Task]: [Expected complexity]
- ...
```

### 2. Update Implementation Status
1. Check the `TECH_DEBT_PREVENTION.md` Component Ownership Matrix
2. Update the implementation status of any components worked on
3. Ensure documentation accurately reflects the current state of the code

### 3. Document Technical Debt
If any technical debt was identified or created during the session, document it according to the format in `TECH_DEBT_PREVENTION.md`:

```markdown
## Technical Debt Item

**Category**: [Architectural|Implementation|Duplication|Testing|Documentation]
**Component**: Affected component
**Priority**: [High|Medium|Low]
**Estimated Effort**: [Small|Medium|Large]

### Description
Detailed description of the technical debt item

### Impact
Consequences of not addressing this debt

### Resolution Approach
Proposed approach to resolve this debt

### Created
Date when this debt was identified
```

### 4. Update API Documentation
If any APIs or interfaces were modified or created:
1. Update relevant JSDoc comments in the code
2. Ensure the interface definitions match the implementation

### 5. Generate Summary Report
Provide a concise summary to the user including:
1. What was accomplished in the session
2. Current project state
3. Next priority tasks 
4. Any critical issues or blockers

## Implementation Notes
- Always create the `.cursor/sessions/` directory if it doesn't exist
- Session files should follow the naming pattern `YYYY-MM-DD-session-summary.md`
- Check for and create the latest session file
- If multiple session files exist for the current date, append a numeric suffix
- Always commit session documentation to maintain project history
