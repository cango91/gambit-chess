## Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-03-31
**Focus**: WebSocketController Event Dispatching Implementation
**Status**: Completed implementation of duel and retreat event dispatching

### Implemented Components
- **WebSocketController**: Enhanced - Implemented missing methods for dispatching duel outcomes and retreat options
- **IEventDispatcher Interface**: Complete - Fully implemented all required event dispatching methods
- **GameManager Integration**: Enhanced - Connected event dispatching to game logic for duels and retreats
- **ChessEngine**: Enhanced - Added proper board handling for captures and retreats

### Key Decisions
- **Player-Specific Event Dispatch**: Implemented player-specific event dispatching for duel outcomes and retreat options
- **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling for socket-related issues in event dispatching
- **Sequence Tracking**: Added comments for future implementation of sequence number tracking
- **Consistent Event Format**: Maintained consistent GameEvent format across all dispatched events

### Known Limitations
- **Sequence Numbers**: Sequence numbers for events are not yet properly implemented
- **Reconnection Logic**: Event queuing during disconnections is not fully implemented
- **Testing Coverage**: Need more comprehensive tests for event dispatching scenarios
- **Error Recovery**: Socket errors could be handled more robustly with automatic retry mechanisms

### Next Priority Tasks
- **Event Sequence Management**: Medium complexity - Implement proper sequence number tracking for events
- **Reconnection Event Queue**: Medium complexity - Implement event queuing for disconnected players
- **Integration Testing**: Medium complexity - Create comprehensive tests for the full WebSocket communication flow
- **Client Implementation**: Medium complexity - Implement the client side of the WebSocket protocol

## Technical Debt Item

**Category**: Implementation
**Component**: WebSocketController
**Priority**: Medium
**Estimated Effort**: Small

### Description
The WebSocketController implementation of the dispatchDuelOutcome and dispatchRetreatOptions methods currently lacks proper sequence number management, which is critical for ensuring events are processed in the correct order, especially after reconnections.

### Impact
Without proper sequence numbers, events may be processed out of order after a reconnection, potentially leading to game state inconsistencies and player confusion.

### Resolution Approach
1. Implement a per-game or per-player sequence counter
2. Update all event dispatch methods to use proper sequence numbers
3. Add sequence validation on the client side
4. Create a mechanism to request missed events based on sequence number gaps

## Technical Debt Item

**Category**: Architecture
**Component**: WebSocketController
**Priority**: Medium
**Estimated Effort**: Medium

### Description
The current WebSocketController lacks a robust reconnection mechanism with event queuing. When players disconnect and reconnect, they may miss important events that occurred during their disconnection.

### Impact
Players who disconnect momentarily may miss critical game events like duel outcomes or retreat options, making it difficult to understand the current game state upon reconnection.

### Resolution Approach
1. Implement an event queue per player
2. Store events for disconnected players
3. Send queued events upon reconnection
4. Add a client-side mechanism to request missed events
