# Initial Project Setup Session

## Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-03-27
**Focus**: Cursor Rules Setup
**Status**: Completed

### Implemented Components
- **Cursor Rules Framework**: Complete - Created a comprehensive set of rules files to guide AI development
- **Project Documentation Organization**: Complete - Documentation structure in place and ready for implementation

### Key Decisions
- Created hierarchical rules structure following Cursor IDE best practices
- Implemented specific triggers for project familiarization and session handoff
- Established domain boundaries in rules to enforce architectural principles
- Set up rule-based enforcement of TypeScript, React, and chess implementation standards

### Known Limitations
- Rules will need to be converted from .md to .mdc format manually
- Some rules may need refinement as the project develops
- Session management process will evolve as project complexity increases

### Next Priority Tasks
- Set up workspace package.json files for client, server, and shared packages
- Implement core shared types and interfaces
- Create basic board representation and chess logic
- Begin implementing client-side components
- Start server development with WebSocket communication

## Notes for Next Session
- Follow the domain boundary rules strictly
- Reference the Component Ownership Matrix when implementing new components
- Document session progress according to the handoff protocol
- Create tests for all implemented components
