## Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-03-28
**Focus**: Shared module event definitions and validation
**Status**: Completed shared events module with validation and tests

### Implemented Components

- **Shared Event Definitions**: **Complete** - Defined comprehensive event interfaces for all game events that can be shared between client and server, including move events, duel events, retreat events, game state events, player events, spectator events, chat events, and error events.

- **Event Validation**: **Complete** - Implemented validation functions for each event type to ensure payload correctness, with proper type checking and boundary enforcement.

- **Event Tests**: **Complete** - Created comprehensive test suite for event interfaces and validation functions, improving code coverage for the events module.

- **GameState Utilities**: **Removed** - Removed the previously implemented `gameState.ts` utilities as they violated domain boundaries by containing server-only logic in the shared module.

### Key Decisions

- **Domain Boundary Enforcement**: Strictly enforced proper domain boundaries by removing server-specific filtering logic from the shared module. Server code will now be responsible for filtering game state according to visibility rules before sending to clients.

- **Event Typing System**: Implemented a clear typing system for events with a discriminated union pattern using `type` property as the discriminator. This provides strong type safety while maintaining flexibility.

- **Validation Strategy**: Created individual validation functions for each event type, plus a general `validateSharedEvent` function that delegates to the appropriate validator based on event type. This allows for both targeted and generalized validation.

### Known Limitations

- **Event Coverage**: While we've defined a comprehensive set of events, there may be edge cases or special game situations that require additional event types as implementation progresses.

- **Test Coverage**: Although test coverage for events is high, some complex validation logic branches may still need additional tests for complete coverage.

### Next Priority Tasks

- **Game Manager Implementation**: **High Complexity** - Implement the server-side GameManager service to handle game state management, adhering to domain boundaries and information architecture rules.

- **Move Processor Implementation**: **Medium Complexity** - Create the MoveProcessor service to handle move validation and execution on the server.

- **BP Manager Implementation**: **Medium Complexity** - Develop the BPManager service to handle Battle Points allocation, regeneration, and duel resolution.

- **WebSocket Controller**: **Medium Complexity** - Implement the WebSocket controller to handle real-time communication between clients and server using the defined shared events.

### Technical Debt

- None identified in this session.

### Implementation Status Updates

- Shared Event Definitions: Updated from Planned to Implemented
- Event Validation: Updated from Planned to Implemented 

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Server GameManager Service**:
   - Create a basic GameManager class that manages game sessions
   - Implement game state management that adheres to domain boundaries
   - Develop filtering logic for game state based on player visibility
   - Integrate with the shared event system

2. **Server MoveProcessor Service**:
   - Implement move validation using shared chess logic
   - Create move execution functionality that updates game state
   - Add check/checkmate detection
   - Handle capture attempts by initiating duels

3. **Server BPManager Service**:
   - Develop Battle Points allocation system
   - Implement BP regeneration logic
   - Create duel resolution mechanism
   - Maintain player BP pools with proper visibility rules

4. **WebSocket Communication Layer**:
   - Set up WebSocket controller using the shared event interfaces
   - Implement event handlers for all event types
   - Create endpoint for game creation and joining
   - Build authentication and session management

## API Documentation Status

- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments to all shared event interfaces in `events/index.ts`
- Created detailed validation documentation in `events/validation.ts`
- Removed server-specific logic from shared module to maintain clean domain boundaries
- Expanded test coverage for the events module with a comprehensive test suite
- Maintained proper exports in shared module's main `index.ts` file to include new event definitions

## Implementation Approach

For the GameManager service implementation, follow these steps:
1. Define the GameManager class with appropriate state management
2. Implement methods for creating, joining, and managing game sessions
3. Create helper methods for filtering game state according to visibility rules
4. Add event handling logic for all supported game events
5. Ensure proper integration with other services (MoveProcessor, BPManager)
6. Add comprehensive tests for all GameManager functionality

This approach ensures we maintain proper domain boundaries while implementing the server-side component of the game logic.
