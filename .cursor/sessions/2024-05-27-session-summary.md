## Session Summary

**Date**: 2024-05-27
**Focus**: Server-side implementation of Gambit Chess Phase 1
**Status**: Completed Phase 1 server implementation

### Implemented Components

- **DuelManager**: ✅ Completed - Handles BP allocation and duel resolution for capture attempts
- **TacticalRetreatManager**: ✅ Completed - Calculates and validates retreat options after failed captures
- **StateSynchronizer**: ✅ Completed - Filters game state information based on player/spectator visibility rules
- **ServiceFactory Integration**: ✅ Completed - All managers registered with ServiceFactory for dependency injection
- **Server Documentation**: ✅ Completed - Comprehensive README for the server component

### Key Decisions

- **Game State Filtering**: Implemented a StateSynchronizer with explicit type extensions to handle game-phase-specific hidden information
- **Modular Manager Structure**: Separated duel and retreat functionality into dedicated managers instead of merging into GameManager
- **Domain Boundaries**: Strictly enforced information boundaries, ensuring BP allocations are hidden from opponents until revealed
- **Interface-First Development**: Created proper interfaces before implementations to ensure consistency

### Known Limitations

- **BP Regeneration**: Tactical advantage detection for BP regeneration not fully implemented yet
- **Game Persistence**: Current implementation keeps games in memory without persistence
- **Performance Optimization**: No specific optimizations for high-volume games

### Next Priority Tasks

- **BP Regeneration Implementation**: Medium complexity - Implement tactical advantage detection for BP regeneration
- **Game Persistence**: Medium complexity - Add database storage for game state
- **WebSocket Controller Enhancement**: Medium complexity - Improve reconnection handling and session recovery
- **Server-Side Validation**: Medium complexity - Add comprehensive validation for all client inputs

### Technical Debt

- Some utility functions should be refactored for better code reuse
- Need to implement comprehensive test suite for duel and retreat functionality
- Server-side validation could be improved with a more robust validation framework
