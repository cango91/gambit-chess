## Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-03-29
**Focus**: Server Board Implementation and Architecture Refactoring
**Status**: Core components refactored and completed

### Implemented Components

- **Board**: Complete - Refactored from inheritance to composition with BoardSnapshot, added proper cloning, checkmate/stalemate detection, and draw conditions
- **GameStateService**: Complete - Updated to work with new Board class, fixed state transitions
- **TacticalDetectorService**: Partial - Framework implemented, actual detection algorithms need completion
- **TacticalRetreatService**: Complete - Updated to work with Board composition pattern

### Overall Project Approach

We're following a 2-phase implementation strategy for the Gambit Chess server:

**Phase 1: Core Game Engine** (Current Focus)
- Complete chess rule implementation (moves, captures, check, checkmate)
- Implement Gambit Chess mechanics (BP system, duels, tactical retreats)
- Build tactical advantage detection for BP regeneration
- Create state management and game progression logic
- Ensure proper information filtering between domains

**Phase 2: Network, Security & Infrastructure**
- Implement WebSocket communication layer
- Add player/spectator authentication and management
- Develop session handling and persistence
- Implement security measures and content filtering
- Set up deployment infrastructure and scaling

This session has made significant progress on Phase 1, with most core chess mechanics now implemented. The remaining Phase 1 work focuses on completing tactical detection algorithms and testing before moving to Phase 2 components.

### Key Decisions

- **Architectural Change**: Switched from inheritance to composition for Board-BoardSnapshot relationship to establish clearer domain boundaries
- **Information Hiding**: Implemented toSnapshot() method in Board to explicitly control what information is exposed to clients
- **Sequence Numbers**: Added sequence numbers to GameStateDTO for state reconciliation between client and server
- **Type Safety**: Fixed several type safety issues with optional properties and method signatures

### Known Limitations

- **Tactical Detection Algorithms**: Detection algorithms for pins, forks, etc. are currently placeholders that need actual implementation
- **Draw Detection**: Draw by insufficient material only covers basic cases, may need expansion for edge cases

### Next Priority Tasks

- **Implement Tactical Detection Algorithms**: Complete the detection algorithms for pins, forks, skewers, etc. (Medium complexity)
- **Unit Test Suite**: Create comprehensive unit tests for Board, GameStateService, and tactical detection (Medium complexity)
- **Implement Player/Spectator Management**: Build out player and spectator tracking capabilities (Medium complexity)
- **Client-Server Synchronization**: Ensure robust state reconciliation between client and server (High complexity)

## Technical Debt Item

**Category**: Implementation
**Component**: TacticalDetectorService
**Priority**: Medium
**Estimated Effort**: Medium

### Description
The TacticalDetectorService currently has placeholder implementations for detecting tactical advantages (pins, forks, skewers, etc.). These need to be properly implemented with algorithms that can accurately identify chess tactics in various board positions.

### Impact
Without proper tactical detection, the BP regeneration system won't work correctly, potentially creating balance issues in gameplay where players don't receive proper BP for creating tactical advantages.

### Resolution Approach
1. Implement each tactical detection algorithm separately (pins, forks, skewers, etc.)
2. Create unit tests with predefined board positions known to contain these tactics
3. Ensure each algorithm only detects newly created tactics by comparing previous and current board states
4. Optimize algorithms for performance as these will run frequently
