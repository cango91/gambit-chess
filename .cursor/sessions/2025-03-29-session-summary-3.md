## Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-03-29
**Focus**: GameManager Implementation and Architecture Enhancement
**Status**: Completed GameManager implementation and supporting infrastructure

### Implemented Components

- **GameManager**: Complete - Implemented comprehensive game lifecycle orchestrator that ties together all game engine components
- **ServiceFactory**: Complete - Enhanced with proper dependency injection and service management for GameManager
- **RedisGameRepository**: Complete - Implemented for game state persistence with GameManager integration
- **Config Module**: Complete - Minor side task: consolidated configuration files into a central config module

### Overall Project Progress

The implementation has successfully reached a significant milestone with the GameManager as our cornerstone component:

1. **GameManager Architecture**: 
   - Comprehensive lifecycle management from game creation to completion
   - Player assignment and session tracking
   - Coordination of all game engine services (GameStateService, BPManager, etc.)
   - Event dispatching system for real-time updates
   - Game snapshot management and persistence

2. **Core Game Services Integration**: 
   - GameStateService fully integrated with GameManager for game rules and state transitions
   - BPManager connected to provide battle points mechanics
   - TacticalDetector and TacticalRetreatService properly orchestrated

3. **Data Persistence**: 
   - RedisGameRepository implemented and integrated with GameManager
   - Proper serialization/deserialization of complex game states
   - Game state retrieval and storage with appropriate TTL settings

4. **Service Architecture**: 
   - ServiceFactory for clean dependency injection and service management
   - Proper interfaces established for modular system design
   - Consolidated configuration system (minor enhancement)

### Key Decisions

- **GameManager as Central Orchestrator**: Designed GameManager as the central coordination point for all game components
- **Event-Based Architecture**: Implemented IEventDispatcher interface for extensible real-time communication
- **Snapshot Management**: Created efficient game snapshot system for quick state access
- **Service Factory Pattern**: Implemented for clean dependency injection and service management
- **Redis Integration**: Chosen for scalable game state persistence

### Known Limitations

- **WebSocket Implementation**: WebSocket controller for real-time game communication still needs implementation
- **Authentication System**: User authentication and authorization not yet implemented
- **Client-Side Components**: UI components for game interaction pending
- **Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive testing needed for all components

### Next Priority Tasks

- **WebSocket Controller**: Implement WebSocket event handling using the GameManager's event system (High complexity)
- **Client-Side Implementation**: Build the UI components for game interaction (High complexity)
- **Authentication System**: Add user authentication and authorization (Medium complexity)
- **Integration Testing**: Implement tests for WebSocket communication (Medium complexity)

## Technical Debt Item

**Category**: Architecture
**Component**: WebSocket Communication
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Effort**: Medium

### Description
While the GameManager is designed to work with WebSockets through the IEventDispatcher interface, the actual WebSocket implementation is still using a no-op dispatcher. This creates a gap between the server's game state management and client communication.

### Impact
Without proper WebSocket implementation, real-time game updates cannot be delivered to clients, making the game unplayable in a multiplayer context despite having the core game logic implemented.

### Resolution Approach
1. Implement a WebSocketController that uses Socket.IO
2. Connect the controller to GameManager through a proper IEventDispatcher implementation
3. Define clear message formats for game events
4. Implement client-side WebSocket event handling
