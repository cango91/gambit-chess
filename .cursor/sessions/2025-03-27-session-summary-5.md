## Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-03-27
**Focus**: Check Detection Implementation in Shared Layer
**Status**: Completed

### Implemented Components
- **CheckDetector**: Complete - Implemented shared utility for detecting check and checkmate conditions
- **CheckDetector Tests**: Complete - Comprehensive tests for check detection functionality
- **Component Integration**: Complete - Properly integrated with board state and movement patterns

### Key Decisions
- **Shared Implementation**: Implemented check detection in the shared layer to serve both client (for UX) and server (for authoritative validation)
- **Pure Utility Functions**: Designed the module with pure functions taking the board state as input rather than maintaining state
- **Domain Boundaries**: Maintained strict domain boundaries by requiring server to remain the authority for game progression
- **Edge Case Handling**: Added proper validation for move success in the `wouldMoveResolveCheck` function
- **Test Approach**: Implemented a variety of test scenarios including different piece types and blocking scenarios

### Known Limitations
- **Performance**: The current implementation checks all possible attacker moves, which could be optimized
- **Integration with Board**: The board's native `isInCheck` method still exists independently - consider refactoring to use the shared implementation
- **Test Coverage**: While functionality is tested, there could be more edge cases covered
- **Interaction with Tactical Retreat**: How check conditions interact with tactical retreat options needs further exploration

### Technical Debt Status
- Updated the Component Ownership Matrix to reflect implementation of CheckDetector
- Fixed bug in wouldMoveResolveCheck function to properly validate move success
- Comprehensive JSDoc documentation added to explain usage patterns
- No new technical debt introduced

### Next Priority Tasks
- **CheckDetector/Board Integration**: Medium - Consider refactoring BoardSnapshot to delegate to the new shared implementation
- **Board Movement Integration**: Medium - Check detection could be better integrated with the isValidMove logic
- **Server Implementation**: Medium - Implement authoritative check and checkmate detection in server domain
- **Client UX Implementation**: Medium - Implement UX features using shared check detection (highlighting king in check, filtering legal moves)
- **Tactical Advantage Detection**: Large - Implement the tactical advantage detection system for BP regeneration
