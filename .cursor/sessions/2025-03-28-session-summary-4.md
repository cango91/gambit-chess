## Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-03-28
**Focus**: Shared module event updates and server architecture redesign
**Status**: Completed shared event definitions, redesigned server architecture approach

### Implemented Components

- **Shared Event Definitions**: **Enhanced** - Added missing event interfaces for game control (resign, draw offer/response), connection management (ping), and player/spectator management (name setting, spectator joining).

- **Event Validation**: **Enhanced** - Implemented validation functions for all new event types with proper type checking and boundary enforcement.

- **Event Tests**: **Enhanced** - Expanded test coverage to include all newly defined events and validators.

- **Server Architecture**: **Redesigned** - Shifted from internal event-based architecture to service-oriented architecture for better control flow, testability, and maintainability.

### Key Decisions

- **Server Architecture Approach**: Decided to implement a service-oriented architecture for the server instead of the previously planned internal event-based system. This will provide cleaner control flow, better testability, and more predictable behavior while still maintaining WebSocket-based client-server communication.

- **Game Manager as Coordinator**: Defined the Game Manager Service as the central coordinator that manages game sessions and delegates specific responsibilities to specialized services (Board Service, BP Manager, Tactical Detector, Timer Service).

- **Documentation Alignment**: Updated all architecture documentation to reflect the new service-oriented approach while maintaining compliance with security and information visibility requirements.

- **Event Definitions Clean-up**: Removed redundant `GamePhaseChangeEvent` as its functionality is covered by the more comprehensive `gameState.update` event.

### Known Limitations

- **Websocket Controller Implementation**: The WebSocket controller that will map client messages to service methods still needs to be implemented.

- **Internal Service Communication**: We need to design clear interfaces between services to ensure proper coordination without tight coupling.

- **Stateful Session Management**: The current design assumes stateful session management, which could present scaling challenges in the future.

### Next Priority Tasks

- **Server Game Manager Service**: **High Complexity** - Implement the core GameManagerService that will coordinate game state and other services.

- **Server Board Service**: **Medium Complexity** - Implement the BoardService for board state management and move validation.

- **Server BP Manager Service**: **Medium Complexity** - Implement the BPManagerService for Battle Points allocation, regeneration and duel resolution.

- **WebSocket Controller**: **Medium Complexity** - Create the controller to handle WebSocket connections and route messages to appropriate services.

### Technical Debt

No new technical debt was identified during this session.

## Implementation Status Updates

- Shared Event Definitions: Updated from Implemented to Enhanced
- Event Validation: Updated from Implemented to Enhanced
- Server Architecture: Updated from Planned to Redesigned

## API Documentation Status

- Added JSDoc comments for all new event interfaces and validation functions
- Updated documentation to reflect the removal of GamePhaseChangeEvent
- Updated architecture documentation to reflect service-oriented approach

## Implementation Approach

For the server implementation, follow these guidelines:

1. Start with implementing the GameManagerService first as the central coordinator
2. Create clear interfaces for service interactions
3. Implement specialized services with well-defined responsibilities
4. Build the WebSocket controller to map client events to service methods
5. Use Redis for state persistence with in-memory performance optimizations

This approach ensures we maintain proper domain boundaries and security requirements while moving to a more maintainable service-oriented architecture.
