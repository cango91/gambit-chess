## Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-03-31
**Focus**: BP Regeneration System Implementation
**Status**: Completed core functionality

### Implemented Components
- **BPRegenerationManager**: Complete - Core manager for calculating and processing BP regeneration from tactical advantages
- **GameManager Integration**: Complete - Added BP regeneration processing to the move handling flow
- **IEventDispatcher Interface**: Enhanced - Added BP regeneration event dispatching methods
- **WebSocketController Integration**: Complete - Connected GameManager with WebSocketController for BP event dispatching

### Key Decisions
- **Real-time BP Notification**: BP regeneration events are dispatched in real-time to players when they occur
- **Information Hiding**: Only the player who regenerated BP gets notified, maintaining the strategic aspect of BP pools
- **Service Factory Pattern**: Used ServiceFactory for dependency injection and management of the BPRegenerationManager
- **Interface-First Development**: Enhanced interfaces before implementation to ensure proper contract adherence
- **Event-Based Architecture**: Leveraged event dispatching for all BP regeneration notifications

### Known Limitations
- **Tactical Detection Depth**: Some complex tactical advantages may not be detected in all scenarios
- **Performance Optimization**: BP regeneration calculations could be optimized for large-scale deployments
- **Visualization**: Client-side visualization of BP regeneration not yet implemented
- **Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive testing for all BP regeneration scenarios needed

### Next Priority Tasks
- **BP Regeneration Testing**: Medium complexity - Create comprehensive tests for all tactical advantage scenarios
- **Client Visualization**: Medium complexity - Implement UI components for displaying BP regeneration events
- **Performance Optimization**: Low complexity - Profile and optimize BP regeneration calculations
- **Edge Case Handling**: Medium complexity - Add handling for complex tactical advantage scenarios

## Technical Debt Item

**Category**: Implementation
**Component**: IEventDispatcher
**Priority**: Medium
**Estimated Effort**: Small

### Description
The IEventDispatcher interface was extended to include BP regeneration events, but the WebSocketController implementation of these methods is minimal. It needs more robust error handling, reconnection logic, and proper event queueing.

### Impact
If WebSocket connections are unstable, players may miss BP regeneration notifications, leading to confusion about their current BP pools and diminishing the strategic element of the game.

### Resolution Approach
1. Enhance WebSocketController with proper error handling for all event dispatching methods
2. Implement event queueing for disconnected players to receive events upon reconnection
3. Add robust reconnection logic with session recovery
4. Create better logging for debugging event dispatch issues

## Technical Debt Item

**Category**: Architecture
**Component**: GameManager
**Priority**: Medium
**Estimated Effort**: Medium

### Description
The GameManager implementation of the IGameManager interface has stub implementations for several methods required by the interface. These methods need proper implementation to fully support game functionality.

### Impact
While BP regeneration works, other game features like tactical retreats, BP allocation for duels, and game termination may not function correctly, limiting the full gameplay experience.

### Resolution Approach
1. Implement the missing logic for processBPAllocation, processRetreatSelection, and other stub methods
2. Create comprehensive tests for each method
3. Ensure proper integration with the event dispatcher for all game events
4. Update documentation for each method

## Technical Debt Item

**Category**: Testing
**Component**: BPRegenerationManager
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Effort**: Medium

### Description
The BPRegenerationManager lacks comprehensive testing, especially for complex tactical advantage scenarios like double attacks, discovered checks, and multiple simultaneous advantages.

### Impact
Without thorough testing, some tactical advantages may not be correctly detected or may provide incorrect BP regeneration amounts, affecting game balance and player experience.

### Resolution Approach
1. Create a test suite with predefined board positions for each tactical advantage type
2. Test combinations of multiple tactical advantages
3. Test edge cases like advantages that appear and disappear in the same move
4. Verify BP regeneration calculations against expected values
