## Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-03-27
**Focus**: Chess Notation Implementation in the Shared Domain
**Status**: Completed refactoring and enhancement of the chess notation implementation

### Implemented Components
- **Chess Notation Module (`shared/src/notation/index.ts`)**: Completed - Fully refactored with enhanced error handling, input validation, and better documentation
- **Notation Tests (`shared/src/tests/notation/index.test.ts`)**: Completed - Enhanced with additional test cases for BP regeneration and retreat notation

### Key Decisions
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added comprehensive validation for all inputs to prevent runtime errors
- **Better Documentation**: Added detailed JSDoc comments to clarify function behavior and parameters
- **Strict Input Validation**: Implemented strict validation for move objects, duel data, and retreat information
- **Improved Parsing Logic**: Fixed issues with retreat notation parsing and BP regeneration extraction
- **Enhanced Visibility Rules**: Clarified and enforced information visibility rules according to game requirements

### Known Limitations
- **Move Disambiguation**: Current notation doesn't handle move disambiguation (when multiple pieces of the same type can move to the same square)
- **Browser Support**: The client-side decompression in knightRetreatUtils.ts still needs better browser compatibility testing
- **Performance Optimization**: Large PGN files parsing could be optimized with stream processing or worker threads

### Next Priority Tasks
- **Move Disambiguation**: Implement disambiguation rules for SAN notation - Medium complexity
- **Extended Validation**: Add more comprehensive move validation rules - Medium complexity
- **Performance Testing**: Test with large game databases - Low complexity
- **Board Snapshot Testing**: Increase test coverage for the BoardSnapshot class - Medium complexity

## Technical Debt Item

**Category**: Implementation
**Component**: Chess Notation Parser
**Priority**: Low
**Estimated Effort**: Small

### Description
The current PGN parser uses regex-based extraction that might not handle all complex PGN formatting variants, especially non-standard comments or nested annotations.

### Impact
Potential parsing failures for complex PGN files imported from external sources or chess databases.

### Resolution Approach
Implement a proper tokenizer and parser for PGN files following the standard grammar, with better handling of nested structures and annotations.

## API Documentation Updates

Updated JSDoc comments were added to all public functions in the notation module, including:
- `pieceTypeToSAN`: Converts a chess piece type to its SAN symbol
- `sanToPieceType`: Converts a SAN symbol to a chess piece type
- `moveToSAN`: Converts a chess move to SAN notation
- `toGambitNotation`: Converts a move to Gambit Chess extended notation
- `preDuelNotation`: Generates notation with appropriate visibility for pre-duel state
- `generateVisibleGameHistory`: Applies information visibility rules to move history
- `parsePGN`: Parses a PGN string to an array of moves
- `parseGambitNotation`: Parses Gambit Chess notation into move components
- `toPGN`: Converts a move history to PGN format

All these functions now have comprehensive parameter descriptions, return type documentation, and error handling notes.
