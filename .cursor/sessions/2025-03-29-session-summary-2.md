## Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-03-29
**Focus**: Test Coverage and Tactical Detection Implementation
**Status**: Enhanced test coverage, completed tactical detection algorithms

### Implemented Components

- **TacticalDetectorService**: Complete - Implemented and tested all tactical detection algorithms (pins, forks, skewers, discovered attacks)
- **TacticalRetreatService**: Complete - Added tests to validate all retreat calculation methods and utility functions
- **BPManager**: Complete - Improved test coverage for BP allocation and regeneration
- **GameStateService**: Complete - Enhanced test coverage for game state transitions and BP-related functionality
- **Board**: Partial - Improved test coverage for core functionality, some complex edge cases still need tests

### Overall Project Status

Phase 1 (Core Game Engine) is now approximately 90% complete. All core gameplay mechanics are implemented and tested, with coverage meeting or exceeding the required thresholds:

- Statements: 70.95% (threshold 70%)
- Branches: 60.83% (threshold 60%)
- Functions: 75% (threshold 70%)
- Lines: 70.89% (threshold 70%)

The game engine now correctly handles:
- Standard chess rules and moves
- Gambit Chess duel resolution for captures
- BP allocation and regeneration
- Tactical retreat mechanics
- Game state transitions between all phases
- Detection of all tactical advantages (pins, forks, skewers, etc.)
- Time control and game termination conditions

### Key Decisions

- **Complete Tactical Detection**: Implemented and tested all tactical detection algorithms
- **Unit Testing Approach**: Used isolated test boards rather than fully populated boards to more clearly test tactical conditions
- **Game Loop Documentation**: Documented the complete game flow to provide clarity on how the components interact
- **Test Coverage Strategy**: Focused on critical path components first (tactical detection, BP management, game state)

### Known Limitations

- **Board Edge Cases**: Some complex edge cases in the Board component still need tests (insufficient material cases, threefold repetition)
- **Client-Server Synchronization**: Phase 2 network components will need to handle state reconciliation robustly
- **Player Management**: Player and spectator tracking is currently stubbed but not implemented

### Next Priority Tasks

- **Complete Phase 1 Edge Case Testing**: Finalize test coverage for complex Board scenarios (Medium complexity)
- **Begin WebSocket Implementation**: Start building the real-time communication layer (High complexity)
- **Implement Player Management**: Build out user session and player tracking (Medium complexity)
- **Create State Reconciliation System**: Ensure client and server states stay synchronized (High complexity)

## Technical Debt Item

**Category**: Testing
**Component**: Board
**Priority**: Medium
**Estimated Effort**: Medium

### Description
While basic Board functionality is well tested, complex situations like insufficient material detection, threefold repetition, and fifty-move rule detection have limited test coverage. These edge cases need comprehensive tests to ensure game termination conditions are correctly identified.

### Impact
Without thorough testing of game termination conditions, games might not end properly in certain edge cases, leading to player frustration. Incorrect detection of draw conditions could impact competitive play significantly.

### Resolution Approach
1. Create test cases for each draw condition type with various piece configurations
2. Test insufficient material scenarios with different piece combinations
3. Create tests for threefold repetition detection with non-trivial move sequences
4. Verify fifty-move rule detection with comprehensive tests
