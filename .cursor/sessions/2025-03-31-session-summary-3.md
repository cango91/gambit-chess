## Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-03-31
**Focus**: Gambit Chess Server WebSocket Event Dispatching
**Status**: Completed implementation of remaining event dispatchers

### Implementation Progress

In this session, we completed the implementation of the remaining event dispatching methods in the WebSocketController class, specifically focusing on duel outcomes and tactical retreat options. These methods enable the server to properly communicate with clients about important game events during the duel and retreat phases.

#### Completed Components:

1. **WebSocketController**:
   - Implemented `dispatchDuelOutcome` method to send duel results to players
   - Implemented `dispatchRetreatOptions` method to send available retreat positions
   - Added proper error handling for missing sockets
   - Implemented consistent event format across all dispatchers

2. **IEventDispatcher Interface**:
   - Enhanced interface to include all required dispatching methods
   - Added proper documentation for interface methods

3. **GameManager**:
   - Properly connected BP regeneration handling to event dispatching
   - Completed capture and retreat processing with proper event notifications

4. **ChessEngine**:
   - Enhanced board handling for captures and retreats
   - Implemented proper validation for both standard moves and special tactics

#### Integration Points:

The WebSocketController now properly implements all methods required by the IEventDispatcher interface, ensuring consistent communication between game logic and clients. The event dispatching system handles:

- Duel outcomes (success/failure)
- Tactical retreat options
- BP regeneration notifications
- Error handling for all game events

### Next Steps

1. **Sequence Number Management** (Medium Priority):
   - Implement proper tracking of event sequence numbers
   - Create logic for detecting and requesting missed events

2. **Reconnection Event Queue** (Medium Priority):
   - Implement event storage for disconnected players
   - Create mechanism to replay missed events on reconnection

3. **Client Implementation** (High Priority):
   - Implement client-side event handlers for all server events
   - Create UI components for BP duels and tactical retreats

4. **Testing** (High Priority):
   - Create integration tests for the full WebSocket communication flow
   - Test edge cases like disconnection during critical game phases

### Technical Debt

Two significant technical debt items were identified:

1. **Sequence Number Management**: The current implementation uses placeholder values for sequence numbers, which need to be properly implemented to ensure correct event ordering.

2. **Reconnection Logic**: The system lacks robust handling of reconnections with event queuing, potentially causing players to miss critical events.

These items have been documented in the technical debt register with medium priority for future sprints.
