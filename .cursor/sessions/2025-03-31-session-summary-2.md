## Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-03-31
**Focus**: Configuration refactoring for BP regeneration
**Status**: Complete - Improved config system with domain boundary enforcement

### Implemented Components
- **GameConfig Structure**: Enhanced - Created a proper server implementation of the shared GameConfig interface
- **BPRegenBonuses**: Implemented - Added full implementation of the BP regeneration bonus functions
- **TacticalDetectorService**: Refactored - Updated to use the new configuration system for BP calculation
- **BPManager**: Refactored - Modified to utilize the new configuration values
- **ConfigController**: Implemented - New controller for delivering configuration to clients
- **BP Bonus Descriptions**: Added - Created human-readable descriptions of BP regeneration formulas

### Key Decisions
- **Domain Boundary Enforcement**: Removed function serialization that violated domain boundaries
- **Server Authority**: Maintained server as the single source of truth for BP regeneration calculation
- **Transparent Game Rules**: Added clear descriptions to help players understand BP regeneration without exposing calculation logic
- **Configuration Structure**: Organized configuration by domain (game settings, chat settings, network settings)

### Known Limitations
- **Client Integration**: The client-side components that would display these BP regeneration descriptions are not yet implemented
- **Configurability**: Some configuration values are hardcoded that could be moved to environment variables
- **Human-readable Descriptions**: The descriptions could benefit from UX review to ensure they're easily understood by players

### Next Priority Tasks
- **Client UI Components**: Create UI elements to display BP regeneration descriptions - [Medium]
- **WebSocket Event Integration**: Properly integrate config events into the WebSocket controller - [Small]
- **Game Logic Completion**: Implement the remaining game mechanics - [Large]
- **Testing**: Add comprehensive tests for BP regeneration calculation - [Medium]

### Technical Debt
- **Type Definition Improvements**: The `any` type is used in a few places where more specific types could be defined
- **BPRegenBonusDescriptions** could be improved with internationalization support
- **ConfigController** returns an extended type that could be defined more formally
- **Implicit Use of 'any'** in various type parameters that could be made explicit
