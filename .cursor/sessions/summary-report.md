# Session Hand-off Summary Report

## Accomplishments

We have successfully completed the Phase 1 implementation of the Gambit Chess server component with the following key achievements:

1. **Core Game Mechanics Implementation**:
   - Created DuelManager to handle Battle Point allocations and duel resolution
   - Implemented TacticalRetreatManager for handling retreat options after failed captures
   - Developed StateSynchronizer for maintaining information boundaries

2. **Architecture Improvements**:
   - Defined proper interfaces for all manager components
   - Ensured all implementations adhere to their interfaces
   - Registered managers with ServiceFactory for dependency injection
   - Maintained strict domain boundaries between client, server, and shared code

3. **Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive README for the server component
   - Generated detailed JSDoc comments for all public APIs
   - Created session documentation for future reference

## Current Project State

The Gambit Chess server now has a solid foundation with:

1. **Core Infrastructure**:
   - WebSocket event handling
   - Player session management
   - Spectator support
   - Service registration and dependency injection

2. **Game Mechanics**:
   - DuelManager for Battle Point duels
   - TacticalRetreatManager for failed capture retreats
   - Game state filtering based on information visibility rules

3. **Information Security**:
   - Hidden information properly filtered
   - Validated state synchronization
   - Proper event-based communication

## Next Priority Tasks

1. **BP Regeneration Implementation** (Medium complexity):
   - Implement tactical advantage detection
   - Calculate BP regeneration amounts
   - Integrate with the GameManager

2. **Game Persistence** (Medium complexity):
   - Design database schema for game state
   - Implement save/load functionality
   - Add game history support

3. **Testing Infrastructure** (High priority):
   - Create comprehensive test suite for duel and retreat mechanics
   - Implement integration tests for manager interactions
   - Add automated validation tests

## Critical Issues / Blockers

1. **Technical Debt**: 
   - StateSynchronizer implementation uses type extensions and casting, which could be brittle
   - Need for better test coverage before proceeding with further feature development
   - Some code duplication across manager implementations

2. **Known Limitations**:
   - No BP regeneration from tactical advantages yet
   - Game state is currently kept in memory without persistence
   - No performance optimizations for high-volume gameplay

This hand-off provides a solid foundation for further development of the Gambit Chess server component, with clear next steps and documented technical debt.
