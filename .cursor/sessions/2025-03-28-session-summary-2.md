## Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-03-28
**Focus**: Domain Boundary Enforcement & Check Detection Enhancement
**Status**: Completed

### Implemented Components
- **Domain Boundary Documentation**: Complete - Added explicit documentation about game state progression being server-only
- **Check Detection Test Fixes**: Complete - Fixed tests for pinned piece movement with correct chess behavior
- **Self-Check Detection**: Complete - Verified proper implementation of check prevention validation
- **README Updates**: Complete - Enhanced documentation about domain boundaries and responsibilities

### Key Decisions
- **Domain Boundary Clarification**: Added explicit documentation in both README.md and board.ts clarifying that game state progression logic (checkmate, stalemate, draw detection) belongs exclusively to the server domain
- **Pin Movement Behavior**: Updated tests to align with chess rules where pinned pieces can only move along the pin line or capture the pinning piece
- **Test Coverage**: Verified test coverage is sufficient (76.3% overall) with critical chess validation logic well-covered

### Known Limitations
- **Test Coverage**: Some parts of board.ts still have low coverage (59.29%)
- **Index Files**: Several index.ts files have 0% coverage, though these are just re-export files
- **Constants Coverage**: The knight retreat utilities have some uncovered edge cases (66.07% coverage)

### Technical Debt Status
- Addressed the domain boundary violation concerns mentioned in previous session
- Added explicit documentation in both README.md and board.ts clarifying domain responsibilities
- Fixed test cases that had incorrect expectations about pinned piece movement

### Next Priority Tasks
- **Server-Side Game Logic**: High - Begin implementing the server-side game progression logic that was intentionally excluded from shared
- **Client Integration**: Medium - Integrate the shared library with the client for move validation and UI updates
- **Documentation**: Low - Add more examples of how to use the shared library in server and client contexts

## Technical Debt Item

**Category**: Documentation
**Component**: Shared Library
**Priority**: Low
**Estimated Effort**: Small

### Description
While domain boundaries are now well-documented at the module level, individual functions throughout the codebase would benefit from clearer documentation about which domain they belong to and their relationship to server-side authority.

### Impact
New developers might still be confused about which functions are purely for validation vs. which ones impact game state. This could lead to accidental domain boundary violations in the future.

### Resolution Approach
Add JSDoc tags to all public functions indicating their domain responsibility (validation-only, information-only, etc.) and their relationship to server authority.

### Created
