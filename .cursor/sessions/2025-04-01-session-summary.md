## Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-04-01
**Focus**: Server WebSocket Controller, DTOs for duel information
**Status**: Implemented with testing complete

### Implemented Components
- **WebSocketController**: Complete - Implemented WebSocket controller for managing secure game events and client connections
- **DuelInfoDTO**: Complete - Created shared DTO for duel information passing between server and client
- **GameStateDTO**: Enhanced - Updated to include duel information for real-time game state synchronization
- **GambitChessEngine**: Enhanced - Modified to properly handle and transmit duel state to clients

### Key Decisions
- **DuelInfoDTO Integration**: Added duel information directly to the primitive GameStateDTO rather than extending it, simplifying the type system and ensuring compatibility with existing converters
- **Information Visibility**: Implemented proper restrictions where each player only sees their own BP allocation status, but can see that the opponent has allocated (without amounts)
- **BP Allocation Flow**: Designed two-phase allocation system where each player's allocation is confirmed before the duel is resolved
- **Tactical Advantages**: Moved tactical advantages to server-side only, with BP regeneration effects communicated to clients without revealing the underlying mechanics

### Known Limitations
- **WebSocket Security**: Current implementation uses a simplified authentication mechanism that would need enhancement for production use
- **Duel Resolution Timing**: Current implementation doesn't account for network latency in time calculations which could affect allocation windows
- **Session Management**: In-memory session storage limits horizontal scaling; would need Redis or similar for distributed deployment

### Next Priority Tasks
- **Client-side Duel UI**: Implement user interface for duels - Medium complexity
- **Tactical Advantage Visualization**: Create visual indicators for tactical advantage effects without revealing exact mechanics - Medium complexity
- **BP Allocation Animation**: Add animations for the allocation and resolution process - Low complexity
- **Game History**: Implement move history with duel outcomes - Medium complexity

## Technical Debt Item

**Category**: Implementation
**Component**: WebSocketController
**Priority**: Medium
**Estimated Effort**: Small

### Description
The current WebSocket implementation uses a placeholder token management system that needs to be replaced with a proper JWT-based authentication system.

### Impact
The current implementation could allow session hijacking in certain scenarios, limiting the security of the application.

### Resolution Approach
Implement a proper JWT authentication system with refresh tokens and integrate it with the existing secure message wrapper.

## Technical Debt Item

**Category**: Testing
**Component**: Duel Resolution
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Effort**: Medium

### Description
The duel resolution process lacks comprehensive unit and integration tests, particularly for edge cases like simultaneous allocation and disconnect scenarios.

### Impact
Without proper testing, bugs in the duel system could create unfair game outcomes and harm player experience.

### Resolution Approach
Create a comprehensive test suite for the duel system, covering all expected interactions and edge cases. Include simulated network latency testing.
