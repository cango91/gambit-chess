# Technical Debt Items

## Technical Debt Item

**Category**: Implementation
**Component**: Utility Functions
**Priority**: Medium
**Estimated Effort**: Small

### Description
Several utility functions across managers have similar functionality that could be refactored into common shared utilities. For example, both DuelManager and TacticalRetreatManager have similar patterns for managing game-specific state.

### Impact
Duplicate code makes maintenance more difficult and increases the risk of inconsistent behavior between similar functionalities. Changes to one area might not be properly propagated to similar areas.

### Resolution Approach
Create a shared utilities module with common patterns extracted from the managers. Update all managers to use these shared utilities. Add proper tests to ensure consistent behavior.

## Technical Debt Item

**Category**: Testing
**Component**: Duel and Retreat Mechanics
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Effort**: Medium

### Description
The DuelManager and TacticalRetreatManager components lack comprehensive test coverage. Current implementation has been manually tested but lacks automated tests for edge cases and integration scenarios.

### Impact
Without proper test coverage, future changes might introduce regressions in the core game mechanics that could be difficult to detect. Given these are critical game features, reliability is essential.

### Resolution Approach
Implement a comprehensive test suite covering:
1. Unit tests for all manager methods
2. Integration tests for the interaction between managers
3. Scenario-based tests for common game situations
4. Edge case testing for unusual game states

## Technical Debt Item

**Category**: Architectural
**Component**: StateSynchronizer
**Priority**: Medium
**Estimated Effort**: Medium

### Description
The current StateSynchronizer implementation uses type extensions and casting to handle game-specific state properties. This approach can be brittle as it relies on runtime type assertions rather than compile-time type safety.

### Impact
Type mismatches might only be discovered at runtime, potentially causing bugs in production. The code is also more difficult to maintain as the relationship between types is not explicitly defined in the type system.

### Resolution Approach
Refactor the StateSynchronizer to use a more type-safe approach:
1. Define proper interfaces for all game state variations
2. Use generics to handle different state types
3. Implement a more robust state filtering system that doesn't rely on type casting
4. Add runtime validation to ensure state integrity
