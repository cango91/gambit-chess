## Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-03-27
**Focus**: Notation System Enhancements
**Status**: Completed

### Implemented Components
- **Gambit Notation Information Hiding**: Complete - Implemented proper information hiding for BP regeneration and duel allocations
- **PGN Format with View Context**: Complete - Enhanced PGN converter to respect viewer perspective
- **Notation Parsing Robustness**: Complete - Improved parsing of special notation cases and placeholder handling
- **Session Handoff Protocol**: Complete - Documented session progress and component status

### Key Decisions
- **Selective BP Regeneration Visibility**: BP regeneration is now only visible to the player who made the move until game over
- **Placeholder System for Duels**: Used `OPPONENT_BP_PLACEHOLDER` constant for hidden BP allocations
- **Viewer Context Parameter**: Added viewer color and game state parameters to control information visibility
- **Regex Pattern Enhancement**: Improved regex patterns to handle edge cases and placeholders
- **Default Parameter Values**: Made function parameters optional where appropriate for better API usability

### Known Limitations
- **Type Safety**: The move arrays in some functions use `any[]` type, which could be improved with stronger typing
- **Memoization**: Some expensive parsing operations could benefit from memoization for performance
- **Edge Case Testing**: Additional test cases would improve coverage for complex notation scenarios
- **Documentation**: More examples in JSDoc comments would help developers understand usage

### Technical Debt Status
- Updated the Component Ownership Matrix to reflect implemented components
- No new technical debt introduced during this session
- `GambitNotation` component status changed from "Planned" to "Implemented"
- `PGNConverter` component status changed from "Planned" to "Implemented"

### Next Priority Tasks
- **Move Type Definitions**: Small - Create specific types for move arrays instead of using `any[]`
- **Enhanced Testing**: Medium - Add more comprehensive tests for notation edge cases
- **Performance Optimization**: Small - Consider memoization for performance-sensitive parse operations
- **Reference Documentation**: Medium - Add detailed usage examples to help developers

### API Documentation Status
- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments to all public functions
- Documented parameters and return types with descriptions
- Included information hiding behavior in function documentation
- Updated internal interface documentation
- Provided clear examples of notation format extensions
