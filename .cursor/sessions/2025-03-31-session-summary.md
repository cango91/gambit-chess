## Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-03-31
**Focus**: Server-side implementation - Fixing buildability issues
**Status**: Major progress - Server now builds successfully

### Implemented Components
- **GameState Types**: Fixed - Removed references to metadata and moveHistory properties
- **InMemoryGameRepository**: Fixed - Updated to align with GameState type
- **RedisGameRepository**: Fixed - Removed references to metadata and moveHistory properties
- **TacticalDetectorService**: Fixed - Added type annotations to resolve implicit 'any' type errors 
- **TypeScript Configuration**: Enhanced - Enabled allowSyntheticDefaultImports in tsconfig.json

### Key Decisions
- **Type Alignment**: Used type definitions from the shared module properly instead of recreating them
- **Repository Pattern**: Simplified the repositories to work with the current GameState structure
- **Error Handling**: Fixed type errors pragmatically with minimal changes to maintain existing functionality

### Known Limitations
- **Client Integration**: The client workspace is not yet implemented
- **Game State Serialization**: The serialization methods in RedisGameRepository need further refinement
- **Board Implementation**: The Board class implementation is still incomplete

### Next Priority Tasks
- **Client Setup**: Set up the client workspace structure - [Medium]
- **WebSocket Protocol**: Complete the WebSocket protocol implementation for real-time game updates - [Medium]
- **Game Logic**: Implement complete chess rules and Gambit Chess mechanics - [Large]
- **Database Integration**: Properly integrate Redis for game state persistence - [Medium]

### Technical Debt
- The TacticalDetectorService uses `any` type annotations as a quick fix, which should be replaced with proper types
- The GameManager and ChessEngine have placeholder implementations that need to be completed
- Integration tests for the server components are missing
- The current WebSocketController implementation is minimal and needs expansion
