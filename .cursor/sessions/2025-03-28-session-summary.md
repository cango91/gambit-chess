## Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-03-28
**Focus**: Check Detection Refactoring in Shared Layer
**Status**: Completed

### Implemented Components
- **Check Detection Refactoring**: Complete - Eliminated circular dependency between board and checkDetector modules
- **Board Integration**: Complete - Made BoardSnapshot delegate to the checkDetector for check-related functionality
- **Domain Boundary Enforcement**: Complete - Properly maintained boundary between shared and server domains

### Key Decisions
- **Created IBoardForCheckDetection Interface**: Created a lightweight interface in checkDetector.ts that specifies only what the module needs from a board, replacing the direct import of BoardSnapshot
- **Delegation Pattern**: Made BoardSnapshot.isInCheck() delegate to the shared isKingInCheck function to avoid logic duplication
- **Tactical Advantage Detection Boundaries**: Identified that tactical advantage detection belongs in the server domain, not shared domain
- **Shared CheckDetector Approach**: Allowed both client and server to use the same check detection logic for UI validation and move filtering, while maintaining server as the authority
- **Game Progression Boundaries**: Confirmed that checkmate, stalemate, and draw detection belong in the server domain, not shared domain

### Known Limitations
- **Test Coverage**: Some parts of the board.ts file still have low test coverage (60.08%)
- **Boundary Violations**: BoardSnapshot contains methods like isCheckmate() and isDraw() that violate domain boundaries by implementing game state progression logic that belongs in the server
- **Domain Separation**: Better documentation needed to clarify which board methods are for UI/validation only vs. game state progression
- **Integration Testing**: More tests that verify board and checkDetector integration would be beneficial

### Technical Debt Status
- Updated implementation approach for check detection to eliminate circular dependencies
- Improved code organization by properly respecting domain boundaries for check detection
- Fixed duplication of logic between board.isInCheck and checkDetector.isKingInCheck
- Identified boundary violations in BoardSnapshot related to game state progression

### Next Priority Tasks
- **Remove Boundary Violations**: Medium - Move or clearly mark as non-authoritative the checkmate, stalemate, and draw logic in BoardSnapshot
- **Complete Test Coverage**: Medium - Add tests for uncovered parts of board.ts and checkDetector.ts
- **Documentation**: Small - Update comments to clearly indicate domain boundaries and non-authoritative nature of client-side checks
- **BoardSnapshot Cleanup**: Medium - Separate UI validation functionality from game state progression

## Technical Debt Item

**Category**: Architectural
**Component**: BoardSnapshot
**Priority**: Medium
**Estimated Effort**: Medium

### Description
The BoardSnapshot class contains methods like isCheckmate() and isDraw() that implement game state progression logic, violating the domain boundary principle that places this responsibility with the server.

### Impact
Domain boundary violations lead to confusion about source of truth, potential duplicate logic between client and server, and increased maintenance burden.

### Resolution Approach
Either:
1. Remove these methods from the shared BoardSnapshot class and implement them solely in server code, or
2. Clearly mark them as "preview" methods for client-side UX only, with clear documentation that server remains authoritative for game state progression
