## Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-03-30
**Focus**: Server Implementation Type Compatibility with Shared Module
**Status**: Completed - Fixed server implementation to properly use the refactored shared package types

### Implemented Components
- **PlayerSessionManager**: Fixed - Updated to use proper ChessPieceColor value comparisons
- **Board**: Fixed - Corrected handling of ChessPosition, ChessPieceType, and captured pieces
- **GameStateService**: Fixed - Updated to use PIECE_COLOR factory function and corrected DTO structure
- **Shared/Server Type Integration**: Fixed - Ensured proper type usage across server components

### Key Decisions
- **Value Object Pattern Usage**: Explicitly used .value property for comparisons on ChessPieceColor and ChessPieceType
- **Factory Functions**: Consistently used POSITION, PIECE_COLOR, and PIECE_TYPE factory functions from shared module
- **Null Safety**: Added proper null/undefined handling for optional properties
- **Deep Copy Strategy**: Improved clone method implementation with proper type filtering

### Known Limitations
- **GameStateDTO Evolution**: The shared GameStateDTO structure has evolved, and the server implementation needed updates to match
- **Board.capturedPieces Type Safety**: Required additional type guards to ensure proper handling of captured pieces
- **RetreatOptionsDTO Structure**: Changed to match updated shared definition with options array

### Next Priority Tasks
- **WebSocket Controller Implementation**: Implement WebSocket controller using GameManager's event system (High complexity)
- **Client-Side Implementation**: Build the UI components for game interaction (High complexity)
- **Authentication System**: Add user authentication and authorization (Medium complexity)
- **Integration Testing**: Implement tests to verify the fixed type compatibility (Medium complexity)

## Technical Debt Item

**Category**: Implementation
**Component**: Board and GameStateService
**Priority**: Medium
**Estimated Effort**: Small

### Description
The refactored types from the shared package required fundamental changes to how object comparisons are performed. Instead of direct string comparisons (e.g., `color === 'white'`), the code now needs to use the value property of ValueObject instances (e.g., `color.value === 'w'`). This pattern needs to be consistently applied throughout the codebase.

### Impact
Inconsistent comparisons could lead to type errors and runtime bugs, particularly in game state transitions where piece colors are compared.

### Resolution Approach
1. Review all remaining components for string literal comparisons with chess types
2. Update all comparisons to use the value property of ValueObject types
3. Add explicit null checking where appropriate
4. Consider creating helper functions for common comparison patterns
