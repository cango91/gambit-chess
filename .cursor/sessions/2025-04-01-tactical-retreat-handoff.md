## Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-04-01
**Focus**: Tactical Retreat Implementation in GameManager and WebSocketController
**Status**: Implemented and integrated

### Implemented Components
- **GameManager**: Enhanced - Added tactical retreat support with methods for getting retreat options and executing retreats
- **WebSocketController**: Enhanced - Updated to handle tactical retreat requests using the new GameManager methods
- **TacticalRetreatService Integration**: Complete - Successfully integrated the existing TacticalRetreatService with the game flow

### Key Decisions
- **Service Architecture**: Used the existing TacticalRetreatService as a dependency in GameManager rather than reimplementing its functionality
- **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling for invalid retreats, including position validation and BP cost verification
- **Response Format**: Created a consistent response format for retreat options with validation status and error messaging

### Known Limitations
- **Client UI**: The server-side implementation is complete, but client-side UI components for tactical retreats still need development
- **Animation Integration**: The transition from failed capture to retreat needs animation guidance in the client implementation
- **Retreat Indicators**: Visual indicators for valid retreat squares are needed in the client UI

### Next Priority Tasks
- **Client-side Retreat UI**: Implement user interface for tactical retreats - Medium complexity
- **Retreat Animation Flow**: Design animations for the retreat process after failed captures - Low complexity
- **TacticalRetreatService Tests**: Add comprehensive test coverage for the retreat calculation logic - Medium complexity
- **BP Cost Visualization**: Create visual indicators for the BP cost of different retreat options - Low complexity

## Technical Debt Item

**Category**: Implementation
**Component**: TacticalRetreatService
**Priority**: Medium
**Estimated Effort**: Small

### Description
The current implementation calculates retreat options on demand, which could be optimized by pre-calculating and caching common retreat patterns for each piece type.

### Impact
During complex game states with multiple potential retreats, there might be slight performance impacts when calculating all options.

### Resolution Approach
Implement a caching system for retreat patterns based on piece type and position, refreshing only when the board state changes significantly.

## Technical Debt Item

**Category**: Testing
**Component**: Retreat Execution
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Effort**: Medium

### Description
The tactical retreat execution flow lacks integration tests, particularly for edge cases like retreating to the edge of the board or retreating after a complex sequence of moves.

### Impact
Without proper testing, bugs in the retreat system could lead to illegal moves or game state corruption.

### Resolution Approach
Create a comprehensive test suite for the retreat system, covering various board configurations and piece types.
