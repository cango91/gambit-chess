## Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-03-27
**Focus**: Knight Retreat System in Shared Layer
**Status**: Completed

### Implemented Components
- **Knight Retreat Data Generation**: Complete - Implemented pre-build script to generate knight retreat lookup tables
- **Knight Retreat Utilities**: Complete - Created utility functions for decompressing and using the retreat data
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Complete - Set up Jest with TypeScript and coverage reporting
- **Tactical Retreat Calculation**: Complete - System for calculating valid retreat options after failed captures
- **Core Project Structure**: Complete - Directory organization, build system, documentation

### Key Decisions
- **Data vs. Functionality Separation**: Split knight retreat data (generated at build time) from utility functions
- **Compression Strategy**: Used gzip compression for the knight retreat table to minimize bundle size
- **Environment Detection**: Added runtime detection for Node.js vs. browser for proper decompression
- **Testing Approach**: Implemented ground truth calculations to validate pre-calculated data
- **Coverage Thresholds**: Set initial thresholds based on current coverage to encourage improvement

### Known Limitations
- **Test Coverage**: Currently at ~48% line coverage, especially low in chess movement (15.6%)
- **Browser Compatibility**: Decompression relies on pako library, which is widely supported but adds a dependency
- **Memory Usage**: The entire knight retreat table is held in memory after first use
- **Documentation**: API docs are minimal and could be expanded

### Technical Debt Status
- Updated the Component Ownership Matrix to reflect implemented components
- No new technical debt introduced during this session
- Low test coverage in chess movement (15.6%) represents existing technical debt that should be addressed
- Memory caching for the knight retreat table is a calculated tradeoff between performance and memory usage

### Next Priority Tasks
- **Expand Test Coverage**: Medium - Implement tests for chess movement rules and remaining utilities
- **Complete Chess Movement Logic**: Medium - Some movement rules may need validation and refinement
- **Add DTO Definitions**: Small - Ensure all needed client-server communication objects are defined
- **Implement Notation System**: Medium - Complete and test chess notation utilities
- **Integration Testing**: Large - Add tests that verify interaction between components 

### API Documentation Status
- Added JSDoc comments to key functions in the knight retreat utilities
- Created TypeScript interfaces with documentation for all retreat-related types
- Implemented function comments documenting the knight retreat algorithm and lookup process
- Updated README.md with usage examples and documentation information
- Set up TypeDoc for generating API documentation via `yarn docs`
